# BetterControls

This is a mod for [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/) that makes remapping controls a bit less annoying.

Specifically, it:
- Lets you remap controls that you couldn't remap before (like the key to open your inventory)
- Lets you remap controls to keys that conflict with other controls (and displays conflicting keys in red)
- Lets you remap controls that could only use mouse buttons to other keys too

A few other things to note:
- Just because two keys are marked in red doesn't mean that they won't both work together; that is only a possibility.
- While an attempt was made to un-hardcode certain keybinds (like the open inventory key), controls may not always act as expected. If a keybind doesn't work as expected, let me know!
- All the keybinds from "Take Items" down to "Transfer all Items" are strongly hardcoded and would be very difficult to change and maintain. So for now, they remain non-overridable.
